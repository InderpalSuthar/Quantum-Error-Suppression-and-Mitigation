# Quantum-Error-Suppression-and-Mitigation
This excercise is the part of the IBM Qiskit Summer School 2024  
In this excercise, we will explore the error suppression and mitigation options available with the Estimator primitive from Qiskit Runtime. You will construct a circuit and observables and submit jobs using the Estimator primitive using different combinations of error mitigation settings. Then, you will plot the results to observe the effects of the various settings.  

These are the error suppression and mitigation options you will use:  
-Dynamical decoupling  
-Measurement error mitigation  
-Gate twirling  
-Zero noise extrapolation (ZNE)
